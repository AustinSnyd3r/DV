### About:

---

This application displays n-Dimensional data in 2D using GLC-L coordinates.
For better class separation, linear discriminant analysis is used to get the optimal angles and threshold for a visualization.
Adjustments to the angles and threshold can be done by using the related slider.
Graphs produced by this program can be panned, zoomed in/out, and scaled.
Graph order can be rearranged.
Analytics generated by this program include the "All Data," "Data Without Overlap," "Overlap Data," and "Worst Case," confusion matrices as well as k-fold cross validation.
