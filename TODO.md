# TODO
1. Angle customization for DSC2
2. Angle optimization for DSC2 + run experiments
3. Turn on/off first line segment
4. Visualize support vectors
5. Write paper -> better classification / worst case set
6. Final report of all new features in DV2.0
7. Separate frequency window
8. Rename vectors to n-D points
9. Allow input of special vectors (angles included)
10. Update documentation
11. Make fully resizeable

# Wish List
1. Create more than 1 projection line
2. Figure out how to visually separate very vertical visualizations (BCI and Satimage datasets)
