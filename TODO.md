# TODO
1. Write paper -> better classification / worst case validation
2. Final report of all new features in DV 2.0
4. Allow input of special vectors (angles included)
5. Update documentation
7. Reorder attributes option
10. Different normalization styles for angle normalization

# Wish List
1. Create more than 1 projection line
2. Figure out how to visually separate very vertical visualizations (BCI and Satimage datasets)
