# TODO
1. Update documentation
2. Regression
3. Create functions for common code in MHyper algorithm (points/classes in space)

# Wish List
1. Create more than 1 projection line
2. Figure out how to visually separate very vertical visualizations (BCI and Satimage datasets)

# NOTES
1. TRY TO CHANGE ANGLESLIDERS to only update points instead of redrawing everything!!!!!
2. SAME as above, but with ColorMenu
3. add scaling weight variables to DV (this can be used in DataObject file too)
4. Update DataObject to only use Active Attributes for DSC2 visualizations
5. DataSetup.java: fix save feature + make saves the same as DV 1.0 (file extension)
6. Look at comments on VisualizationMenu
7. Review: DataVisualization, DV, HBVisualization
8. Fix remove attributes feature
9. fix highlight point feature
10. check HypeBlock for warnings
11. abstract LDFRule drawings functions
12. swapping upper classes is broken
13. create error message functions for DV (try to get rid of multiple calls too)
14. check all accuracy / classification functions for threshold consistency
15. Allow user input for how many times to try optimizing angles
16. Check if angle normalization works
17. Test popout vis panel
18. review analytics again
19. Update Highlight option
