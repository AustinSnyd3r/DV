# TODO
1. Write paper -> better classification / worst case validation
2. Final report of all new features in DV 2.0
3. Separate frequency window
4. Allow input of special vectors (angles included)
5. Update documentation
6. Make fully resizeable

# Wish List
1. Create more than 1 projection line
2. Figure out how to visually separate very vertical visualizations (BCI and Satimage datasets)
