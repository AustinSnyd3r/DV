# TODO
1. Update documentation
2. Set overlap percentage
3. Fix MinMax normalization
4. Regression
5. Combine upper and lower graphs on y-axis

# Wish List
1. Create more than 1 projection line
2. Figure out how to visually separate very vertical visualizations (BCI and Satimage datasets)

# NOTES
1. AngleSliders.java: className, opClassName, upper_or_lower, and bound are redundant. They can be found using curClass.
2. DataSetup.java: fix save feature + make saves the same as DV 1.0 (file extension)
3. Look at comments on VisualizationMenu
4. 
3. Review: DataVisualization, DV, HBVisualization
